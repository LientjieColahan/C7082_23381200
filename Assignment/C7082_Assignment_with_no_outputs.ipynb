        "Mushrooms are a global dietary staple, valued for their low calorie and high nutrient content. A 2023 systematic review by De Cianni *et al.* highlights their umami flavour and potential as a plant-based protein alternative due to their texture and high-quality protein. However, the review notes the prevalence of mycophobia in some regions, driven somewhat by fears of poisoning.\n",

        "These fungi go beyond their culinary role as they emerge as powerful nutraceuticals, offering therapeutic potential in modern healthcare. A comprehensive analysis of fungal nutraceutical constituents conducted by Ma *et al.* (2018) demonstrated that mushrooms possess a diverse array of bioactive molecules including polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, unsaturated fatty acids, phenolic compounds, tocopherols, ergosterols and lectins. This biochemical profile, coupled with their favorable nutritional composition positions mushrooms as potential therapeutic agents in preventive medicine.\n",

        "In Europe, for example, only 60 of the 269 edible mushroom taxa suitable for marketing are commercially cultivated, with the majority being wild varieties which if misidentified can have serious consequences.

        "Machine learning can be leveraged as a tool for the safe commercialisation of wild mushrooms in an industry set to grow from 18.39 million USD (US Dollar) in 2024 to 32.04 million USD by 2032 (Fortune Business Insights, 2024) by enabling accurate and robust classification of edible versus poisonous (or potentially poisonous) mushrooms.\n",

        "Different types of data about mushroom characteristics and their edibility exist in various formats across scientific literature, field guides, and digital repositories. While traditional taxonomic data is often structured in tabular format, capturing features like cap size, stem characteristics, and spore colour, there is also a wealth of visual information available as images. Modern machine learning approaches can leverage both these data sources through ensemble or deep learning techniques. By using both approaches the system can benefit from the strengths of each data format - the precision of measured attributes in tabular data and the rich contextual information present in images - potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions of mushroom edibility than would be possible using either data type alone.\n",

        "In conclusion, this investigation of machine learning approaches for mushroom classification provides context for the development of mutliple machine learning appraoches as steps toward supporting the growing commercial mushroom industry, while highlighting important limitations. Although the random forest classifier demonstrated high accuracy using tabular data, and the convolutional neural network shows potential for image-based classification, neither approach is currently suitable for autonomous deployment. Instead, these methods could be developed in parallel and potentially combined to create a preliminary screening tool to support experts in mushroom identification. This kind of hybrid approach, when used alongside specialist verification, could help address the mycophobia noted by De Cianni et al. (2023) by providing an additional layer of safety verification in the identification process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development of such complementary computational tools becomes increasingly relevant as the mushroom industry expands toward its projected $32.04 million valuation by 2032. Future work should focus on expanding both tabular and image datasets, refining the machine learning architectures, and crucially, investigating how these approaches could be integrated to leverage their respective strengths while maintaining rigorous safety standards. This could eventually enable rapid initial screening of mushrooms, making the rich nutritional and nutraceutical benefits documented by Ma et al. (2018) more accessible, while ensuring safety through mandatory expert verification. There is promise in developing AI-assisted tools that can support specialists in expanding safe access to wild mushrooms' nutritional and therapeutic potential."
