## Background
Mushrooms represent both a nutritious dietary staple and a promising therapeutic resource, containing diverse bioactive compounds and high-quality proteins. Despite their potential, the commercialization of wild mushrooms faces significant challenges, as only 60 of 269 edible European taxa are currently cultivated, with mycophobia and poisoning risks hindering wider adoption. In response to these challenges and an industry projected to reach 32.04 million USD by 2032, this project explores the application of machine learning techniques—specifically ensemble learning for tabular data and deep learning for image classification—as tools to enable rapid and safe mushroom identification for commercialisation.

## Data
The UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository provided the tabular dataset for this project. This hypothetical mushroom dataset based on the 3rd edition of the book guide *Mushrooms and Toadstools* comprises 61069 theoretical capped mushrooms, representing 173 species with 353 mushrooms per species.

Kaggle provided the database of imagery for this project (Kuno-Williams, 2022), these can be accessed via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/derekkunowilliams/mushrooms/data. It contains 8781 jpg files of mushrooms representing 261 species gathered from Google.

## Model
The dual availability of tabular and image datasets facilitated an investigation into two machine learning approaches for mushroom classification. The methodology encompassed feature selection and hyperparameter optimisation for tabular data analysis, while the image classification pipeline incorporated data augmentation techniques, callback implementations, and transfer learning testing various pre-trained architectures to achieve optimal model performance.
